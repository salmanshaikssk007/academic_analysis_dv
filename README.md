## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas` – for data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – for visualization  
  - `numpy` – for numerical operations  
  - `plotly` (if used) – for interactive charts  

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Jupyter installed. You can use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or set up a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy

jupyter notebook Academic_Analysis_DV.ipynb
or
